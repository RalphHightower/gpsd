This is a way to measure the speed of packet lexer dependent scripts
such as the regression suitea.  We do this by measuring the duration of
*gpsfake* parsing a relatively large file.  This measures the currently
installed *gpsd*.  It is hoped that when making changes to the lexer
that this test be performed to avoid performance regressions.

1. Do 'scons install' See links for further information.

2. Change directory to "devtools".

3. Run the test several times: "./fakebench".

4. Discard the first result, this is just to fill caches.  Then
Average the rest of the results.
